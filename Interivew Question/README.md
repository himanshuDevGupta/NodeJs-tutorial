**Q. What is chrome v8 engine?**

V8 is a C++ based open-source JavaScript engine developed by Google. It was originally designed for Google Chrome and Chromium-based browsers ( such as Brave ) in 2008, but it was later utilized to create Node.js for server-side coding.

V8 is the JavaScript engine i.e. it parses and executes JavaScript code. The DOM, and the other Web Platform APIs ( they all makeup runtime environment ) are provided by the browser.

V8 is known to be a JavaScript engine because it takes JavaScript code and executes it while browsing in Chrome. It provides a runtime environment for the execution of JavaScript code. The best part is that the JavaScript engine is completely independent of the browser in which it runs.

**Q. Why is LIBUV needed in Node JS?**

libuv is a C library originally written for Node.js to abstract non-blocking I/O operations. It provides the following features:

It allows the CPU and other resources to be used simultaneously while still performing I/O operations, thereby resulting in efficient use of resources and network.
It facilitates an event-driven approach wherein I/O and other activities are performed using callback-based notifications.
It provides mechanisms to handle file system, DNS, network, child processes, pipes, signal handling, polling and streaming
It also includes a thread pool for offloading work for some things that can't be done asynchronously at the operating system level.
