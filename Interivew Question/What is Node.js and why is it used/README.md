# What is Node.js?
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes code outside of a web browser. It is built on V8, the same JavaScript engine within Chrome, and optimized for high performance. This environment, coupled with an event-driven, non-blocking I/O framework, is tailored for server-side web development and more.

Key Features
Asynchronous & Non-Blocking: Ideal for handling a myriad of concurrent connections with efficiency.
V8 Engine: Powered by Google's V8, Node.js boasts top-tier JavaScript execution.
Libuv Library: Ensures consistent performance across platforms and assists in managing I/O operations.
NPM: A vast package ecosystem simplifies module management and deployment.


## Simple features
- Runs JavaScript on the server so you can use one language for front and back.
- Fast (uses Chrome's V8 engine).
- Non-blocking I/O — can handle many connections at once without waiting.
- npm — a big library of reusable packages.

## Common uses
- Building web APIs and backend servers
- Real-time apps (chat, notifications)
- Streaming audio/video
- Small, independent services (microservices)
- IoT projects (e.g., Raspberry Pi)

Short summary: Node.js is a fast, event-driven way to build scalable server programs with JavaScript.
